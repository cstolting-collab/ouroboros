"""The working-bubble reviewer row: one plain sentence per reviewer, from typed facts.

``review_actor_progress_text`` says who the reviewer is (the frozen route display
name), what it was asked for at start, and at settlement whether it answered, how it
ran, or why it did not. Every case is asserted in both directions: the words that
must appear AND the internal tokens (codes, ids, custody states, a requested model
posing as an observed one) that must never reach the owner.
