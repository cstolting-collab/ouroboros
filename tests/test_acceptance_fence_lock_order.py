"""Runtime proof of the fence's in-process lock order: admission lock -> ``_queue_lock``.

A direct turn applies its acceptance fence inside the supervisor process, so the
queue lock is now taken on the direct agent's own thread — at ``end`` while the
turn's owner-message admission lock is held. Every other party that touches both
locks (steering an owner message to the turn, Stop through
``arm_direct_chat_turn``, project-chat routing, the turn's own finalization, and
``task_done`` clearing the fence) must agree on the same order, or the process
deadlocks. The real code of each party runs here concurrently with in-process
begin/end behind an order-checking admission lock and a bounded join.
