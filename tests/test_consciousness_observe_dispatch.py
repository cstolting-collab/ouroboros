"""What an Observe wake may ASK a tool to do, once it is allowed to call it.

Observe keeps a short list of mutating-table names visible because each has a
genuine read-only or own-work use (``OBSERVE_ARGUMENT_NARROWED``); withholding
the NAME would take that use away with the mutation. The narrowing is therefore
on the ARGUMENTS, at dispatch — the same seam ``test_consciousness_authority``
pins for a withheld name. These are the positive and negative halves of it,
including what a read-only descendant of such a wake may ask for in turn.
