"""A synchronous extension WS handler never stalls the ASGI event loop.

#1195 F3 review follow-up: `ws._dispatch_extension_message` mirrors the HTTP
dispatcher — a coroutine handler is awaited, a synchronous one (including its
synchronous execution-barrier wait) runs in a worker thread. The proof is a
heartbeat coroutine that keeps ticking while the handler is blocked.
