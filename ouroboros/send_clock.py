"""The host clock line sealed into each Main physical model send (#1320, owner 6A/7A).

A task's context is captured once per run, so its ``context_captured_at`` stops
being "now" after the first round. Main instead reads the time of the request it
is answering: every NEW physical candidate a Main call prepares ends with one
host-authored clock line, sampled at that preparation — after any host wait
(backoff, quota wait, account rotation), before the candidate is measured,
priced, sealed and sent — in UTC and, when the sending client reported a valid
IANA zone, in that zone. An absent or unloadable zone is named unknown; the
server's own zone is never presented as the owner's.

Scope: only a Main send binds a policy (``loop_llm_call._send_main_candidate``);
delegated children, Presence, reviewers and helper calls made inside a Main call
(vision, reclaim summaries) bind none and their bytes are unchanged.

Identity: every new physical send samples anew, including compatibility and
processing retries. Request-wire rebinding preserves the canonical tool source
and its applied actions. Rejoining one idempotent invocation retains its bytes.
The line of the send whose response came back becomes canonical history,
appended just before the answer (``main_send_scope``), so the next request
extends the last one byte for byte (OpenAI-family caches reuse only an exact
prefix, #906) and a replay shows what the model actually read. A line no
response consumed is never kept. A priced lookahead (the forced final) carries
a line of its own sample, so it is advice only: equal width is not equal
tokens. The final admission reads the FRESH request — its clock-free digest
(``AttemptRequest.candidate_clock_free_sha256``) must match the lookahead's,
and its OWN price must fit (``loop_forced_finalization._forced_admission_predicate``).
